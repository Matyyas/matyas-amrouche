      institution: At Justice.cool we were building a platform to digitalize and facilitate the management of small litigations cases. Small litigations are legal cases that deal with less than 5000€.
        Our platform enables users with no legal background to easily solve their issues through an online mediation service, accompanying both parts to find an agreement rather than clogging up the courts, resulting in a cheaper, less stressful and less time consuming experience for the user.
        As Lead ML Engineer, I worked with my team on putting state-of-the-art deep learning approaches into production, providing our users and product team with efficient AI features.

        - Designed end-to-end NLP pipeline (from data annotation to final models deployment) to make structured datasets out of raw French jurisprudence by combining state-of-the-art Transformer based neural network CamemBERT with custom architectures.
        - Engineered search engine on ElasticSearch to match user’s queries to associated French jurisprudence. Exploring the combination of both statistical approach (BM25) as document retriever and document embeddings (Siamese CamemBERT) as re-ranker.
        - Engineered from scratch Justice.cool’s Machine Learning REST API using Docker on AWS ElasticBeans. Combining the API endpoints and AWS Lambda to provide developers and product team with easy to integrate ML features as micro-services.
