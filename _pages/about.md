Hello and be welcome on my personal professional page ðŸ‘‹

Machine Learning (ML) is a wide field, and in this ocean, I particularly prefer Deep Learning (DL). When I started 
studying DL, my first impression was: Deep Learning is like magic !  
Since, I have experimented Deep Learning on several 
projects but the enthusiasm of my beginnings has not left me. Rather than magic, I would 
now say in a more nuanced way, I strongly believe that with the sufficient knowledge of the underlying algebra 
mechanics, neural networks can capture the sense of any  unstructured (even structured) data.

Indeed, DL can deal with images, texts, graphs, 
temporal, traditional tabular data and many more. The ability to bend DL to so many different data types and 
leverage its power to a wide range of fields, makes it a unique tool that continues to impress me.
During my professional experience, I have deepen my expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) through 
long-term projects which you can find on my [bio page](/bio/) for more details.

In my current work, I am improving the **search engine's relevance** of <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.leboncoin.fr/" target="_blank">Leboncoin</a>
(the first French e-commerce marketplace ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·). To do so I work as Data Scientist in a multi-profile 
team dedicated to our search engine.
What I love the most in my work is to be in the reactor's core, implementing key parts of 
our neural search engine, such as:
- extracting our usersâ€™ implicit feedbacks to build mutimodal datasets
- modelizing, training and evaluating custom neural network architectures
- deploying DL models in production within a highly constrained environment regarding throughput (up to ~3000 requests per second at peak time) and latency (few dozen of ms response time allowed) 
- evaluating online models' efficiency with A/B testing on business and user's experience KPIs

It's also a great feeling to have a positive impact with DL models on 
a second-hand e-commerce marketplace of approximately 30 million users 
that helps to build a more virtuous economy, reducing waste and 
carbon footprint due to new manufactured items.

On top of my work, I do love to share and write about technical concepts in Machine Learning. 
You can find these articles on my <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://matyasamrouche.medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium profile</a>. 
The motivation behind writing articles is to challenge in depth my understanding of 
every technical details of a concept and to produce a explanation that I would have love to 
read when I was learning. 
And of course, it is not bad for a bit of self promotion ðŸ™‚
